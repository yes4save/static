                  &quot;I got married in 2016 and faced many struggles early in my married life. For 5 years, I didn&apos;t have a child, and it was mentally very hard. I shared my problems with my college friend Raghavi, and she encouraged me to pray and trust Jesus.
                  <br /><br />
                  I&apos;ve loved Jesus since school, but at home, I was scolded for reading the Bible, so I had stopped. Still, my heart was always with Jesus. Quietly, I started joining prayer again. Sister Deepa gave me a lot of guidance. Through Raghavi and Deepa, Jesus called me back to Him.
                  <br /><br />
                  I began reading the Bible daily on my phone and joined night prayers. In 2022, I became pregnant, but during that time, I lost my father, who meant the world to me. I prayed, and Jesus gave me strength.
                  <br /><br />
                  By God&apos;s grace, though my baby girl was born prematurely, she is healthy now, and family problems were also resolved. Truly, nothing is impossible for God. Those who trust in Jesus will never be forsaken.&quot;

                  Last month, I had to take my mother for an orthopedic check-up. Last year was a tough time, but by God&apos;s grace, He protected her life and helped her walk without a walker within four months. I thank God and pray He blesses everyone who supported us. üëè
                  <br /><br />
                  After a year, we were unsure if the rod needed to be removed and whether her bones had healed. But we continued to pray in faith. God gave us a promise: &quot;I will make your bones strong.&quot; He led us to a nearby hospital, and to our joy, the doctor said her bones had healed perfectly, and the rod didn&apos;t need to be removed.
                  <br /><br />
                  I thank and praise Jesus for healing my mother and making her walk again. A special thanks to Yes4Save Foundation, who helped us with her medical expenses on time.&quot;

                  &quot;Glory to God.. This ministry is a powerful prayer ministry.. A few months back, they collected names of unmarried people and prayed for 21 days for 1 hour on Zoom as led by the Holy Spirit.
                  <br /><br />
                  By God&apos;s grace I got engaged even before completing the 21 days of prayer.
                  <br /><br />
                  My friend Subha also got married whose name was also mentioned in the list. We both waited for many years for our marriage and finally it happened soon after the 21 days of prayer.
                  <br /><br />
                  Thanks to our loving Daddy Jesus who heard the prayers of this ministry. Thanks to Raghavi sis who initiated this prayer by obeying God&apos;s voice.&quot;
